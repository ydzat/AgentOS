# AOS – Agent Operating System

---

## Overview

**AOS (Agent Operating System) is a task-driven, agent-oriented intelligent operating system for future creation and collaboration.**

---

## System Positioning

AOS is a foundational platform designed for intelligent creation in the AI-driven future. It adopts a task-centric model and defines the "Agent" as the primary execution unit. It supports intelligent cooperation across fields such as software development, game generation, content creation, document automation, and AI model training.

Rather than replacing traditional operating systems, AOS runs atop Linux, macOS, or Windows as a soft-layer operating system. It encapsulates system resources, orchestrates intelligent agents, manages creative tasks, and ensures that everything aligns with user intent — a true "cognitive kernel."

## Core Advantages

* **Task-driven Architecture**: Initiates workflows from user intent, minimizing traditional programming entry barriers
* **Agent Collaboration**: Supports distributed, layered, and modular execution via coordinated agents
* **Composable Modules**: Encapsulates capabilities via reusable AgentPacks
* **Evolving Ecosystem**: Enables developers to define new agents, while the system itself may spawn new ones from experience

---

## Historical Roots

* **DevNexusLite**: The prototypical application layer of early AOS, representing agent-based software construction tasks
* **Testloom**: The verification subsystem, used to validate modules, identify errors, and suggest rule-based fixes
* **AI Game Creation Platform**: A future content creation branch of AOS, focusing on story-driven and interaction-rich environments

---

## Taglines & Messaging

* “AOS: The intelligent core for everything you create.”
* “Just like ROS is for robots, AOS is for all creative agents.”
* “Wherever AOS reaches, anything can be made.”
* “The operating system for everything you imagine.”

## Key Use Cases

1. **Game Generation**

   * A user describes: “I want a puzzle game like Monument Valley.”
   * AOS activates NexusPlay, calling agents for game planning, scene building, and mechanics composition.
   * A full project is generated including scripts, logic, assets, and build output.

2. **Agent Application Development**

   * A developer wants to create a new AgentApp called “StoryBuilder” to generate interactive fiction.
   * AOS initiates an AgentPack with agents such as StoryAgent, DialogueAgent, and ExportAgent.
   * It generates a boilerplate structure and configuration; the developer focuses only on agent behavior and prompt design.

---

## Future Ecosystem Directions

* **AOS Studio**: A graphical editor for composing agent pipelines and visualizing task execution
* **AOS Shell**: An intelligent command-line interface for managing tasks, agents, and system state
* **AOS Hub**: A marketplace for sharing and downloading AgentPacks
* **AOS Codex**: An internal learning engine to train the next generation of Agent developers

---

## Naming Concept

* **Full Name**: Agent Operating System
* **Abbreviation**: AOS
* **Chinese Name**: 智核 (Zhì Hé) – “Cognitive Core”
